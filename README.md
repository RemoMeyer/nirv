Thanks to [ruby learning blog](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/12/14/ruby-gems-%E2%80%94-what-why-and-how/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+LearningRubyBlog+%28Learning+Ruby+Blog%29) This helped. 

Thanks to [boom](https://github.com/holman/boom). Was a good example to work & learn from. Seems to be doing something similar to what I wanted to do, so picked up some gem tips there. 

Between those two, I have been able to cobble together something that works. :) 

Code reviews & suggestions welcome.
